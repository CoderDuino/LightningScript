# LightningScript
LightningScript is a cross platform executable system
for making web-apps run locally

## Adding Content
Adding content to the LightningScript Base is simple.
First, add all content to the content folder, setting your
main page name to `index.html`. 
Then add all your icons to the icons folder naming them
by image size, such as `16.png` or `32.png` and make sure you have `32.png` at a minimum.

## Running Executable
Run the script or exe according to your platform in your root dir.

## About
LightningScript is based off app.js,
and uses MIT Open Source Licenses.
